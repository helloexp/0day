#! PERL_COMMAND

# This is a Perl script to demonstrate the possibilities of on-the-fly
# delivery filtering in Exim. It is presented with a message on its standard
# input, and must copy it to the standard output, transforming it as it
# pleases, but of course it must keep to the syntax of RFC 822 for the headers.

# The filter is run before any SMTP-specific processing, such as turning
# \n into \r\n and escaping lines beginning with a dot.

# As a demonstration, we extract the "From:" header, add a textual comment
