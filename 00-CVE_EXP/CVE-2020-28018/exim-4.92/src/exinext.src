# A shell+perl script to fish out the next retry time for a given domain;
# it first calls exim to find out which hosts are set up for that domain and
# then fishes out the retry data for each one.

# For testing the selection and formatting logic, and perhaps for use in
# special cases, the script can have an argument -C <filename> to specify
# the use of an alternate Exim configuration file. It may also have any number
# of -D options to set macros that are passed to exim.

# 16-May-1996  Fixed it to do better if routing fails to complete.

# 02-Aug-1996  Lower case the domain.

#              pick up routing delays after temporary recipient errors.
#              Also add unqualified subject if it looks like a message id.
# 01-Apr-2004  Add the -C feature for testing
# 22-Dec-2005  Complete the -C feature (!)
