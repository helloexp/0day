.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BI ftpshut
command provides an automated shutdown procedure that a superuser
can use to automagically disconnect current proftpd connections,
and deny new connections.  The command creates a control file as
.B /etc/shutmsg
to inform proftpd processes about an impending shutdown.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B time
The time at which the ftp servers will be brought down.  It may be the
word `now', indicating an immediate shutdown, or a future time in one
of two formats:
.I +number 
or
.I HHMM.  
The first form brings the servers down in
.I number
minutes, while the second form indicates an exact time of day, using
a 24-hour clock format.
.TP
.B -R
Instructs ftpshut to
.I remove
the /etc/shutmsg file, restoring proftpd to its normal service.  If this option
is used, this will be the only operation performed by
.I ftpshut
.
.TP
.B -l min
Specifies the number of minutes before shutdown that new ftp access will
be disabled.  If the \-l option is not specified, a default of 10 minutes
(or immediately, if less than 10 minutes remains until shutdown) is used.
.TP
.B -d min
Specifies the number of minutes before shutdown that existing ftp
connections will be disconnected.  If the \-d option is not specified,
a default of 5 minutes (or immediately, if less than 5 minutes remains
until shutdown) is used.
.TP
.B warning-message
Optionally provide a message which will be sent to new connections
(if denied) and existing connections (when disconnected).  The message
can contain the following magic cookies, which will be replaced as
follows before being sent to new or existing connections:

.SH CAVEATS
Proftpd servers can only be shutdown via ftpshut if a master daemon
is running in
.I standalone 
mode.  Servers running in
.I inetd 
mode will honor the shutdown message file created by ftpshut, however
currently running servers may be chroot(2)ed, and unable to read
the shutdown message control file.
.PP
It is possible to set an absolute shutdown time which is 
.B earlier 
than the current time.  If this is the case, proftpd will not shutdown
until the indicated time on the following day.
