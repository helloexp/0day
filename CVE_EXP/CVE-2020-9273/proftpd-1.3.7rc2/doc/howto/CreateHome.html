<p>
<b>What is <code>CreateHome</code>?</b><br>
When a site has many user accounts, with users being added and removed
constantly, there is always the associated procedure of creating and removing
those user's home directories.  And often, in such situations, the user
account information is stored in a SQL database or an LDAP server.  A
<code>proftpd</code> daemon can be configured to authenticate against the
SQL database or the LDAP server; this would still leave the task of creating
the actual home directory for that user to be done..  What would help ease this
particular burden on system administrators, though, is the ability to add the
account information and have the new user's home directory created <i>on
demand</i>.  That is, to have a daemon such as <code>proftpd</code> create
the home directory for the user, if that directory did not already exist.

<p>
Now, <code>proftpd</code> already has some modules, such as <code>mod_sql</code>
and <code>mod_ldap</code> that already support this home-on-demand creation
capability.  Each module implements it slightly differently, though.  And
other authentication modules, such as <code>mod_radius</code>, do not support
it at all.  It was decided then, rather than having authentication modules
have largely duplicated code for this feature, to have home-on-demand
creation in the core <code>daemon</code> itself.  And so it is.
As of 1.2.8rc2, <code>proftpd</code> has the
<a href="../modules/mod_auth.html#CreateHome"><code>CreateHome</code></a>
configuration directive.

<p>
<b>How to use <code>CreateHome</code></b><br>
The description for this configuration directive shows its parameters to be:
<pre>
  CreateHome off|on [&lt;mode&gt;] [skel &lt;path&gt;] [dirmode &lt;mode&gt;] [uid &lt;uid&gt;] [gid &lt;gid&gt;] [homegid &lt;gid&gt;] [NoRootPrivs]
</pre>
The first parameter is a simple Boolean, enabling or disabling the
<code>proftpd</code> daemon's run-time support for home directory creation.
The rest of the parameters are optional, and only apply if
<code>CreateHomde</code> is <em>on</em>.

<p>
There is the first <em>mode</em> parameter, used to set the directory mode on
the home directory being created.  As described in the documentation, if this
parameter is omitted the mode used will default to 0700.  There is also the
<code>dirmode</code> <em>mode</em> parameter, which is slightly different.
The <code>dirmode</code> keyword informs the daemon that the following mode
is to be used on directories that may need to be created in order to create
the home directory.  For example, let's assume that a new user, david, is
logging in.  User david has been given the home directory
<code>/home/users/d/da/david</code>.  Since this is a new user, the
directory does not exist.  In fact, <code>/home/users/d</code> does not exist.
When this happens, <code>proftpd</code> will create the <code>d</code>,
<code>da</code>, and <code>david</code> directories.  A <code>dirmode</code>
mode would be applied to the <code>d</code> and <code>da</code> directories,
and the <em>mode</em> (no <code>dirmode</code> keyword) would be applied to
the final <code>david</code> directory.  To illustrate this, assume that
the following <code>CreateHome</code> configuration is in use:
<pre>
  CreateHome on 700 dirmode 711
</pre>
A directory listing would show only the <code>/home/users</code> directory:
<pre>
  drwxr-xr-x    6 root     root         4096 Jan 31 13:23 /home/users
</pre>
After user david logs in, a directory listing might show the new directories
that have been created:
<pre>
  drwxr-xr-x    6 root     root         4096 Jan 31 13:23 /home/users
  drwx--x--x    6 root     root         4096 Jan 31 13:23 /home/users/d
  drwx--x--x    6 root     root         4096 Jan 31 13:23 /home/users/d/da
  drwx------    6 david    david        4096 Jan 31 13:23 /home/users/d/da/david
</pre>
Notice how <code>/home/users/d</code> and <code>/home/users/d/da</code> have
<code>dirmode</code> mode of 711 (<code>rwx--x--x</code>) while
<code>/home/users/d/da/david</code> has the mode of 700
(<code>rwx------</code>).

<p>
As an added feature, <code>CreateHome</code> also supports the ability to
populate these newly created home directories.  This is done by configuring
a &quot;skeleton&quot; directory that will contain files (<i>e.g.</i>
shell initialization files, documentation, notices, subdirectories, etc)
that should be in every new user's home directory.  This is done using
the <code>skel</code> <em>path</em> parameter.

<p>
Be sure to read the documentation for the <code>CreateHome</code> directive,
for there are some restrictions and caveats to both the <code>dirmode</code>
and <code>skel</code> parameters.

<p>
The <code>uid</code> and <code>gid</code> parameters can be used to set the
ownership of the newly created parent directories, up to <b>but not
including</b> the home directory.  By default, those created parent directories
are owned by root (UID 0 and GID 0).

<p>
The <code>homegid</code> parameter can be used to specify the group ownership
of the target home directory itself.  By default, this home directory will
be owned by the user's primary GID.

<p>
The <code>NoRootPrivs</code> parameter can be used to prevent ProFTPD from
using root privileges when creating the home directory and parents. This can be
useful for <i>e.g.</i> the case where home directories are on NFS mounts which
have root squashing enabled.  When the <code>NoRootPrivs</code> option is
used, the home directory in question will be <i>created using the identity
of the logging-in user</i>.

<p>
Here are some examples (from the documentation) to help illustrate how one
might use the <code>CreateHome</code> configuration directive:
<pre>
  <font color=green># Use the CreateHome default settings</font>
  CreateHome on

  <font color=green># Specify a mode of 711 for the created home directory</font>
  CreateHome on 711

  <font color=green># Specify a mode of 711, and have the parent directories owned by a specific non-root UID/GID</font>
  CreateHome on 711 uid 100 gid 100

  <font color=green># Specify a mode of 711, and have the parent directories owned by the UID/GID of the logging-in user</font>
  CreateHome on 711 uid ~ gid ~

  <font color=green># Specify a skeleton directory</font>
  CreateHome on skel /etc/ftpd/skel

  <font color=green># No skeleton, but make sure that intermediate directories have 755
  # permissions.</font>
  CreateHome on dirmode 755

  <font color=green># Skeleton directory, with 700 intermediate directories</font>
  CreateHome on skel /etc/ftpd/skel dirmode 700

  <font color=green># Explicitly configure everything, CreateHome-wise</font>
  CreateHome on 711 skel /etc/ftpd/skel dirmode 700

  <font color=green># Explicitly configure everything, CreateHome-wise.  And do NOT use root privileges when
  # creating the parent directories.</font>
  CreateHome on 711 skel /etc/ftpd/skel dirmode 700 NoRootPrivs
</pre>

<p>
<b>When to use <code>CreateHome</code></b><br>
&quot;What about the prior configuration directives for <code>mod_sql</code>
and <code>mod_ldap</code>?&quot; one asks.  The <code>CreateHome</code>
configuration directive supersedes them.  Those previous module-specific
directives may well be deprecated in the future, in favor of
<code>CreateHome</code>.  Future authentication modules need not try to
reinvent this particular wheel.  <code>CreateHome</code> was designed for
large sites in mind, but can be used any time home-on-demand creation is
desired from the FTP daemon.

<p><a name="FAQ"></a>
<b>FAQ</b>

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: Is it possible to have different permissions
for the <code>CreateHome</code> <em>mode</em> and <em>dirmode</em> based on the
group of the connecting user?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Yes, if you use the <a href="../contrib/mod_ifsession.html"><code>mod_ifsession</code></a> module.
For example:
<pre>
  &lt;IfGroup special&gt;
    CreateHome on 755 dirmode 755
  &lt;/IfGroup&gt;

  &lt;IfGroup !special&gt;
    CreateHome on 711 dirmode 711
  &lt;/IfGroup&gt;
