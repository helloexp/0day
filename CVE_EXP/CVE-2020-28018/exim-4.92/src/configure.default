#                  Runtime configuration file for Exim               #
######################################################################


# This is a default configuration file which will operate correctly in
# uncomplicated installations. Please see the manual for a complete list
# of all the runtime configuration options that can be included in a
# configuration file. There are many more than are mentioned here. The
# manual is in the file doc/spec.txt in the Exim distribution as a plain
# ASCII file. Other formats (PostScript, Texinfo, HTML, PDF) are available
# from the Exim ftp sites. The manual is also online at the Exim website.


# This file is divided into several parts, all but the first of which are
# headed by a line starting with the word "begin". Only those parts that
# are required need to be present. Blank lines, and lines starting with #
# are ignored.

# Whenever you change Exim's configuration file, you *must* remember to    #
# HUP the Exim daemon, because it will not pick up the new configuration   #
# until you do. However, any other Exim processes that are started, for    #
# example, a process started by an MUA in order to send a message, will    #
# see the new configuration as soon as it is in place.                     #
#                                                                          #
# You do not need to HUP the daemon for changes in auxiliary files that    #
# are referenced from this file. They are read every time they are used.   #

######################################################################
#

# Specify your host's canonical name here. This should normally be the fully
# qualified "official" name of your host. If this option is not set, the
# uname() function is called to obtain the name. In many cases this does
# the right thing and you need not set anything explicitly.

# primary_hostname =


# The next three settings create two lists of domains and one list of hosts.
# These lists are referred to later in this configuration using the syntax
# +local_domains, +relay_to_domains, and +relay_from_hosts, respectively. They
# are all colon-separated lists:

domainlist local_domains = @
domainlist relay_to_domains =
hostlist   relay_from_hosts = localhost
# (We rely upon hostname resolution working for localhost, because the default
# uncommented configuration needs to work in IPv4-only environments.)

# Most straightforward access control requirements can be obtained by
# appropriate settings of the above options. In more complicated situations,
# you may need to modify the Access Control Lists (ACLs) which appear later in
# this file.

# The first setting specifies your local domains, for example:
#
#   domainlist local_domains = my.first.domain : my.second.domain
#
# You can use "@" to mean "the name of the local host", as in the default
# setting above. This is the name that is specified by primary_hostname,
# as specified above (or defaulted). If you do not want to do any local
# deliveries, remove the "@" from the setting above. If you want to accept mail
# addressed to your host's literal IP address, for example, mail addressed to
# "user@[192.168.23.44]", you can add "@[]" as an item in the local domains
# list. You also need to uncomment "allow_domain_literals" below. This is not
# recommended for today's Internet.

# The second setting specifies domains for which your host is an incoming relay.
# If you are not doing any relaying, you should leave the list empty. However,
# if your host is an MX backup or gateway of some kind for some domains, you
# must set relay_to_domains to match those domains. For example:
#
# domainlist relay_to_domains = *.myco.com : my.friend.org
#
# This will allow any host to relay through your host to those domains.
# See the section of the manual entitled "Control of relaying" for more
# information.

# The third setting specifies hosts that can use your host as an outgoing relay
# to any other host on the Internet. Such a setting commonly refers to a
# complete local network as well as the localhost. For example:
#
# hostlist relay_from_hosts = <; 127.0.0.1 ; ::1 ; 192.168.0.0/16
#
# The "/16" is a bit mask (CIDR notation), not a number of hosts. Note that you
# have to include 127.0.0.1 if you want to allow processes on your host to send
# SMTP mail by using the loopback address. A number of MUAs use this method of
# sending mail.  Often, connections are made to "localhost", which might be ::1
# on IPv6-enabled hosts.  Do not forget CIDR for your IPv6 networks.

# All three of these lists may contain many different kinds of item, including
# wildcarded names, regular expressions, and file lookups. See the reference
# manual for details. The lists above are used in the access control lists for
# checking incoming messages. The names of these ACLs are defined here:

acl_smtp_rcpt =         acl_check_rcpt
.ifdef _HAVE_PRDR
acl_smtp_data_prdr =    acl_check_prdr

acl_smtp_data =         acl_check_data

# You should not change those settings until you understand how ACLs work.


# If you are running a version of Exim that was compiled with the content-
# scanning extension, you can cause incoming messages to be automatically
# scanned for viruses. You have to modify the configuration in two places to
# set this up. The first of them is here, where you define the interface to
# your scanner. This example is typical for ClamAV; see the manual for details
# of what to set for other virus scanners. The second modification is in the
# acl_check_data access control list (see below).

# av_scanner = clamd:/tmp/clamd


# For spam scanning, there is a similar option that defines the interface to
# SpamAssassin. You do not need to set this if you are using the default, which
# is shown in this commented example. As for virus scanning, you must also
# modify the acl_check_data access control list to enable spam scanning.

# spamd_address = 127.0.0.1 783


# If Exim is compiled with support for TLS, you may want to enable the
# following options so that Exim allows clients to make encrypted
# connections. In the authenticators section below, there are template
# configurations for plaintext username/password authentication. This kind
# of authentication is only safe when used within a TLS connection, so the
# authenticators will only work if the following TLS settings are turned on
# as well.

# Allow any client to use TLS.

# tls_advertise_hosts = *

# Specify the location of the Exim server's TLS certificate and private key.
# The private key must not be encrypted (password protected). You can put
# the certificate and private key in the same file, in which case you only
# need the first setting, or in separate files, in which case you need both
# options.

# tls_privatekey = /etc/ssl/exim.pem

# For OpenSSL, prefer EC- over RSA-authenticated ciphers
# tls_require_ciphers = ECDSA:RSA:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT

# In order to support roaming users who wish to send email from anywhere,
# you may want to make Exim listen on other ports as well as port 25, in
# case these users need to send email from a network that blocks port 25.
# The standard port for this purpose is port 587, the "message submission"
# port. See RFC 4409 for details. Microsoft MUAs cannot be configured to
# talk the message submission protocol correctly, so if you need to support
# them you should also allow TLS-on-connect on the traditional but
# non-standard port 465.

# daemon_smtp_ports = 25 : 465 : 587
# tls_on_connect_ports = 465


# Specify the domain you want to be added to all unqualified addresses
# here. An unqualified address is one that does not contain an "@" character
# followed by a domain. For example, "caesar@rome.example" is a fully qualified
# address, but the string "caesar" (i.e. just a login name) is an unqualified
# email address. Unqualified addresses are accepted only from local callers by
# default. See the recipient_unqualified_hosts option if you want to permit
# unqualified addresses from remote sources. If this option is not set, the
# primary_hostname value is used for qualification.

# If you want unqualified recipient addresses to be qualified with a different
# domain to unqualified sender addresses, specify the recipient domain here.
# If this option is not set, the qualify_domain value is used.

# The following line must be uncommented if you want Exim to recognize
# addresses of the form "user@[10.11.12.13]" that is, with a "domain literal"
# (an IP address) instead of a named domain. The RFCs still require this form,
# but it makes little sense to permit mail to be sent to specific hosts by
# their IP address in the modern Internet. This ancient format has been used
# by those seeking to abuse hosts by using them for unwanted relaying. If you
# really do want to support domain literals, uncomment the following line, and
# see also the "domain_literal" router below.

# allow_domain_literals


# No deliveries will ever be run under the uids of users specified by
# never_users (a colon-separated list). An attempt to do so causes a panic
# error to be logged, and the delivery to be deferred. This is a paranoic
# safety catch. There is an even stronger safety catch in the form of the
# FIXED_NEVER_USERS setting in the configuration for building Exim. The list of
# users that it specifies is built into the binary, and cannot be changed. The
# option below just adds additional users to the list. The default for
# FIXED_NEVER_USERS is "root", but just to be absolutely sure, the default here
# is also "root".

# Note that the default setting means you cannot deliver mail addressed to root
# as if it were a normal user. This isn't usually a problem, as most sites have
# an alias for root that redirects such mail to a human administrator.

never_users = root


# The setting below causes Exim to do a reverse DNS lookup on all incoming
# IP calls, in order to get the true host name. If you feel this is too
# expensive, you can specify the networks for which a lookup is done, or
# remove the setting entirely.

# The settings below cause Exim to make RFC 1413 (ident) callbacks
# for all incoming SMTP calls. You can limit the hosts to which these
# calls are made, and/or change the timeout that is used. If you set
# the timeout to zero, all RFC 1413 calls are disabled. RFC 1413 calls
# are cheap and can provide useful information for tracing problem
# messages, but some hosts and firewalls have problems with them.
# This can result in a timeout instead of an immediate refused
# connection, leading to delays on starting up SMTP sessions.
# (The default was reduced from 30s to 5s for release 4.61. and to
# disabled for release 4.86)
#

# By default, Exim expects all envelope addresses to be fully qualified, that
# is, they must contain both a local part and a domain. If you want to accept

# these hosts by setting one or both of
#
# sender_unqualified_hosts =
# recipient_unqualified_hosts =
#
# to control sender and recipient addresses, respectively. When this is done,

# detail than the default.  Adjust to suit.

# If you want Exim to support the "percent hack" for certain domains,
# uncomment the following line and provide a list of domains. The "percent
# hack" is the feature by which mail addressed to x%y@z (where z is one of
# the domains listed) is locally rerouted to x@y and sent on. If z is not one
# of the "percent hack" domains, x%y is treated as an ordinary local part. This
# hack is rarely needed nowadays; you should not enable it unless you are sure
# that you really need it.
#
# percent_hack_domains =

# As well as setting this option you will also need to remove the test
# for local parts containing % in the ACL definition below.


# When Exim can neither deliver a message nor return it to sender, it "freezes"
# the delivery error message (aka "bounce message"). There are also other
# circumstances in which messages get frozen. They will stay on the queue for
# ever unless one of the following options is set.

# This option unfreezes frozen bounce messages after two days, tries
# once more to deliver them, and ignores any delivery failures.

ignore_bounce_errors_after = 2d

# By default, messages that are waiting on Exim's queue are all held in a
# single directory called "input" which it itself within Exim's spool
# directory. (The default spool directory is specified when Exim is built, and
# is often /var/spool/exim/.) Exim works best when its queue is kept short, but
# there are circumstances where this is not always possible. If you uncomment
# the setting below, messages on the queue are held in 62 subdirectories of
# "input" instead of all in the same directory. The subdirectories are called
# 0, 1, ... A, B, ... a, b, ... z. This has two benefits: (1) If your file
# system degrades with many files in one directory, this is less likely to
# happen; (2) Exim can process the queue one subdirectory at a time instead of
# all at once, which can give better performance with large queues.

# split_spool_directory = true


# If you're in a part of the world where ASCII is not sufficient for most
# text, then you're probably familiar with RFC2047 message header extensions.
# By default, Exim adheres to the specification, including a limit of 76
# characters to a line, with encoded words fitting within a line.
# If you wish to use decoded headers in message filters in such a way
# that successful decoding of malformed messages matters, you may wish to
# configure Exim to be more lenient.

# check_rfc2047_length = false
#
# In particular, the Exim maintainers have had multiple reports of problems
# from Russian administrators of issues until they disable this check,
# because of some popular, yet buggy, mail composition software.

# exchanging email with systems that are not 8-bit clean, then you may
# wish to disable advertising 8BITMIME.  Uncomment this option to do so.

# accept_8bitmime = false


# Exim does not make use of environment variables itself. However,
# libraries that Exim uses (e.g. LDAP) depend on specific environment settings.
# There are two lists: keep_environment for the variables we trust, and
# add_environment for variables we want to set to a specific value.
# Note that TZ is handled separately by the timezone runtime option
# and TIMEZONE_DEFAULT buildtime option.

  #############################################################################
  # The following section of the ACL is concerned with local parts that contain
  # @ or % or ! or / or | or dots in unusual places.
  #
  # The characters other than dots are rarely found in genuine local parts, but
  # are often tried by people looking to circumvent relaying restrictions.
  # Therefore, although they are valid in local parts, these rules lock them
  # out, as a precaution.
  #
  # Empty components (two dots in a row) are not valid in RFC 2822, but Exim
  # allows them because they have been encountered. (Consider local parts
  # constructed as "firstinitial.secondinitial.familyname" when applied to
  # someone like me, who has no second initial.) However, a local part starting
  # with a dot or containing /../ can cause trouble if it is used as part of a
  # file name (e.g. for a mailing list). This is also true for local parts that
  # contain slashes. A pipe symbol can also be troublesome if the local part is
  # incorporated unthinkingly into a shell command line.
  #
  # Two different rules are used. The first one is stricter, and is applied to
  # messages that are addressed to one of the local domains handled by this
  # host. The line "domains = +local_domains" restricts it to domains that are
  # defined by the "domainlist local_domains" setting above. The rule  blocks
  # local parts that begin with a dot or contain @ % ! / or |. If you have
  # local accounts that include these characters, you will have to modify this
  # rule.

  # The second rule applies to all other domains, and is less strict. The line
  # "domains = !+local_domains" restricts it to domains that are NOT defined by
  # the "domainlist local_domains" setting above. The exclamation mark is a
  # negating operator. This rule allows your own users to send outgoing
  # messages to sites that use slashes and vertical bars in their local parts.
  # It blocks local parts that begin with a dot, slash, or vertical bar, but
  # allows these characters within the local part. However, the sequence /../
  # is barred. The use of @ % and ! is blocked, as before. The motivation here
  # is to prevent your users (or your users' viruses) from mounting certain
  # kinds of attack on remote sites.

# This router routes to remote hosts over SMTP by explicit IP address,
# when an email address is given in "domain literal" form, for example,
# <user@[192.168.35.64]>. The RFCs require this facility. However, it is
# little-known these days, and has been exploited by evil people seeking
# to abuse SMTP relays. Consequently it is commented out in the default
# configuration. If you uncomment this router, you also need to uncomment
# allow_domain_literals above, so that Exim can recognize the syntax of
# domain literal addresses.

# This router can be used when you want to send all mail to a
# server which handles DNS lookups for you; an ISP will typically run such
# a server for their customers.  The hostname in route_data comes from the
# macro defined at the top of the file.  If not defined, then we'll use the
# dnslookup router below instead.
# Beware that the hostname is specified again in the Transport.

# The remaining routers handle addresses in the local domain(s), that is those
# domains that are defined by "domainlist local_domains" above.


# This router handles aliasing using a linearly searched alias file with the
# name SYSTEM_ALIASES_FILE. When this configuration is installed automatically,
# the name gets inserted into this file from whatever is set in Exim's
# build-time configuration. The default path is the traditional /etc/aliases.
# If you install this configuration by hand, you need to specify the correct
# path in the "data" setting below.
#
##### NB  You must ensure that the alias file exists. It used to be the case
##### NB  that every Unix had that file, because it was the Sendmail default.
##### NB  These days, there are systems that don't have it. Your aliases
##### NB  file should at least contain an alias for "postmaster".
#
# If any of your aliases expand to pipes or files, you will need to set
# up a user and a group for these deliveries to run under. You can do
# this by uncommenting the "user" option below (changing the user name
# as appropriate) and adding a "group" option if necessary. Alternatively, you
# can specify "user" on the transports that are used. Note that the transports
# listed below are the same as are used for .forward files; you might want
# to set up different ones for pipe and file deliveries from aliases.

# This router handles forwarding using traditional .forward files in users'
# home directories. If you want it also to allow mail filtering when a forward
# file starts with the string "# Exim filter" or "# Sieve filter", uncomment
# the "allow_filter" option.

# The no_verify setting means that this router is skipped when Exim is
# verifying addresses. Similarly, no_expn means that this router is skipped if
# Exim is processing an EXPN command.

# If you want this router to treat local parts with suffixes introduced by "-"
# or "+" characters as if the suffixes did not exist, uncomment the two local_
# part_suffix options. Then, for example, xxxx-foo@your.domain will be treated
# in the same way as xxxx@your.domain by this router. Because this router is
# not used for verification, if you choose to uncomment those options, then you
# will *need* to make the same change to the localuser router.  (There are
# other approaches, if this is undesirable, but they add complexity).

# The check_ancestor option means that if the forward file generates an
# address that is an ancestor of the current one, the current one gets
# passed on instead. This covers the case where A is aliased to B and B
# has a .forward file pointing to A.

# The three transports specified at the end are those that are used when
# forwarding generates a direct delivery to a file, or to a pipe, or sets
# up an auto-reply, respectively.

######################################################################

# The following authenticators support plaintext username/password
# authentication using the standard PLAIN mechanism and the traditional
# but non-standard LOGIN mechanism, with Exim acting as the server.
# PLAIN and LOGIN are enough to support most MUA software.
#
# These authenticators are not complete: you need to change the
# server_condition settings to specify how passwords are verified.
# They are set up to offer authentication to the client only if the
# connection is encrypted with TLS, so you also need to add support
# for TLS. See the global configuration options section at the start
# of this file for more about TLS.
#
# The default RCPT ACL checks for successful authentication, and will accept
# messages from authenticated users from anywhere on the Internet.

begin authenticators

# PLAIN authentication has no server prompts. The client sends its
# credentials in one lump, containing an authorization ID (which we do not
# use), an authentication ID, and a password. The latter two appear as
# $auth2 and $auth3 in the configuration and should be checked against a
# valid username and password. In a real configuration you would typically
# use $auth2 as a lookup key, and compare $auth3 against the result of the
# lookup, perhaps using the crypteq{}{} condition.

#PLAIN:
#  driver                     = plaintext
#  server_set_id              = $auth2
#  server_prompts             = :
#  server_condition           = Authentication is not yet configured
#  server_advertise_condition = ${if def:tls_in_cipher }

# LOGIN authentication has traditional prompts and responses. There is no
# authorization ID in this mechanism, so unlike PLAIN the username and
# password are $auth1 and $auth2. Apart from that you can use the same
# server_condition setting for both authenticators.

#LOGIN:
#  driver                     = plaintext
#  server_set_id              = $auth1
#  server_prompts             = <| Username: | Password:
