# This script takes the following command line arguments:
# -l dir	Log file directory
# -k days	Number of days to keep the log files

# Except when they appear in comments, the following placeholders in this
# source are replaced when it is turned into a runnable script:
#
# CONFIGURE_FILE_USE_NODE
# CONFIGURE_FILE_USE_EUID
# CONFIGURE_FILE
# BIN_DIRECTORY
# EXICYCLOG_MAX
# COMPRESS_COMMAND
# COMPRESS_SUFFIX
# CHOWN_COMMAND

# MV_COMMAND
# RM_COMMAND

# PROCESSED_FLAG

# This is a shell script for cycling exim main and reject log files. Each time
# it is run, the files get "shuffled down" by one, the current one (e.g.
# mainlog) becoming mainlog.01, the previous mainlog.01 becoming mainlog.02,
# and so on, up to the limit configured here. When the number to keep is
# greater than 99 (not common, but some people do it), three digits are used
# (e.g. mainlog.001). The same shuffling happens to the reject logs. All
# renamed files with numbers greater than 1 are compressed.

# This script should be called regularly (e.g. daily) by a root crontab
# entry of the form

# 1 0 * * *   /opt/exim/bin/exicyclog

# The following lines are generated from Exim's configuration file when
# this source is built into a script, but you can subsequently edit them
# without rebuilding things, as long are you are careful not to overwrite
# the script in the next Exim rebuild/install. "Keep" is the number of old log
# files that are required to be kept. Its value can be overridden by the -k
# command line option. "Compress" and "suffix" define your chosen compression
# method. The others are provided because the location of certain commands
# varies from OS to OS. Sigh.
