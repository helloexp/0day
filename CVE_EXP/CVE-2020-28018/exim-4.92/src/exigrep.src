# This is a perl script which extracts from an Exim log all entries
# for all messages that have an entry that matches a given pattern.
# If *any* entry for a particular message matches the pattern, *all*
# entries for that message are displayed.

# We buffer up information on a per-message basis. It is done this way rather
# than reading the input twice so that the input can be a pipe.

# There must be one argument, which is the pattern. Subsequent arguments
# are the files to scan; if none, the standard input is read. If any file
# appears to be compressed, it is passed through zcat. We can't just do this
# for all files, because zcat chokes on non-compressed files.

=head1 NAME

exigrep - search Exim's main log

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<exigrep> [options] pattern [log] ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<exigrep> utility is a Perl script that searches one or more main log
files for entries that match a given pattern.  When it finds  a  match,
it  extracts  all  the  log  entries for the relevant message, not just
those that match the pattern.  Thus, B<exigrep> can extract  complete  log
entries  for  a  given  message, or all mail for a given user, or for a
given host, for example.

If no file names are given on the command line, the standard input is read.

For known file extensions indicating compression (F<.gz>, F<.bz2>, F<.xz>, and F<.lzma>)
a suitable de-compressor is used, if available.

The output is sent through a pager if a terminal is connected to STDOUT. As
pager are considered: C<$ENV{PAGER}>, C<less>, C<more>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-l>|B<--literal>

This means 'literal', that is, treat all characters in the
pattern  as standing for themselves.  Otherwise the pattern must be a
Perl regular expression.  The pattern match is case-insensitive.

=item B<-t>|B<--queue-time> I<seconds>

Limit the output to messages that spent at least I<seconds> in the
queue.

=item B<-I>|B<--sensitive>

Do a case sensitive search.

=item B<-v>|B<--invert>

Invert the meaning of the search pattern. That is, print message log
entries that are not related to that pattern.

=item B<-M>|B<--related>

Search for related messages too.

=item B<--no-pager>

Do not use a pager, even if STDOUT is connected to a terminal.

=item B<-h>|B<--help>

Print a short reference help. For more detailed help try L<exigrep(8)>,
or C<exigrep -m>.

=item B<-m>|B<--man>

Print this manual page of B<exigrep>.
