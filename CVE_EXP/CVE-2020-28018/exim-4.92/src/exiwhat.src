# Shell script for seeing what the exim processes are doing. It gets rid
# of the old process log, then sends SIGUSR1 to all exim processes to get
# them to write their state to the log. Then it displays the contents of
# the log.

# The following lines are generated from Exim's configuration file when
# this source is built into a script, but you can subsequently edit them
# without rebuilding things, as long are you are careful not to overwrite
# the script in the next Exim rebuild/install. However, it's best to
# arrange your build-time configuration file to get the correct values.

rm=RM_COMMAND

# Some operating systems have a command that finds processes that match
# certain conditions (by default usually those running specific commands)
# and sends them signals. If such a command is defined for your OS, the
# following variables are set and used.

multikill_cmd=EXIWHAT_MULTIKILL_CMD
multikill_arg=EXIWHAT_MULTIKILL_ARG

# In other operating systems, Exim has to use "ps" and "egrep" to find the
# processes itself. In those cases, the next three variables are used:

ps_cmd=EXIWHAT_PS_CMD
ps_arg=EXIWHAT_PS_ARG
egrep_arg=EXIWHAT_EGREP_ARG

# In both cases, kill_arg is the argument for the (multi)kill command to send
# SIGUSR1 (at least one OS requires a numeric value).

signal=EXIWHAT_KILL_SIGNAL

# See if this installation is using the esoteric "USE_NODE" feature of Exim,
# in which it uses the host's name as a suffix for the configuration file name.

# one that exists. Mimic the code in readconf.c by testing first for the
